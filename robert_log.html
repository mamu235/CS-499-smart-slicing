<h2> Robert's Weekly Project Log</h2>
<h3>3/9/18</h3>

<p>This week was dedicated to preparing for the Mid-Term presentation. First, we discussed what topics we would talk about, then divided the topics up per person. Once the topics were decided, a presentation was created. I then scheduled a time to meet with PresentaitonU per the instructor. Then presenation was given on Monday March 5th.


<h3>3/2/18</h3>

<p>This week we met with Dr. Deitz on 2/28 to discuss the specifications he desired and how the update of Cura has an affect on the project. </p>

<p>The results of the meeting are as follows:

<ul>
  <li>Traditional printing hold the extrusion axis and z axis constant. Some work has pushed for each layer to have an extrusion variable independent of other layers, but constant within itself, leading to smoother surfaces for things like spheres. This idea is called variable layers, or adaptive layers.</li>
  <li>Very little work has experimented with a layer having a different extrusion variable at different points. This idea is called non-planar layering. This idea can lead to many different advances in 3D printing, with even smoother surfaces since the layer itself is not a flat plane, and a higher searing force tolerance since more forces are distributed across more layers.</li>
  <li>Since non-planer layering is still a new idea, there are many different fields that this idea can be tested in. Since the idea of adding rigidness to printed objects was discussed before the meeting, Team members decided that this should be the application to test non-planar layering.</li>
  <li>A new technique of printing alternating sections of more and less extrusion to create layers that could strengthen will be implemented and developed.</li>
</ul>


</p>

<p>Individually we found designs that could be benefitted with variable layer design, to showcase during the midterm presentaion.</p>

<h3>2/23/18</h3>

<p>This week I scheduled a meeting with Dr. Deitz to clarify the specification, and to alert him of an update to Cura that may satisfy the need. The Presentaion U tutoring appointment was also scheduled. We also had a meeting to discuss how to move forward with our design.</p>

<h3>2/16/18</h3>
<p>This week I contiuned to researching the technique. Christopher found a plugin for Cura, so I was charged with testing the Mac version of the plugin. I was also appointed as the point of contact with Dr. Deitz.</p> 

<h3>2/9/18</h3>
<p>This week the primary goal was to print off the 3D tag neccessary to print in the makers lab in RGAN, and to research the topic. The tag has been created, and a deeper understanding of how to use a 3D printer. This is a big step for me personally as I have never used a 3D printer. I am currently researching for reliable sources that can help us start this project.</p>

<h2>Project Design</h2>

<p>Our Project Design involves varying the Layer height of the fill according to a sinusoidal pattern. 
We can accomplish this by varying the Z layer value, or height value, of the print head while printing, as well as varying the amount of material extruded during that pass.
We will be using the Prusa I3 3D Printers located on Campus as our main means of fabrication. 
We also will be using Cura as a standard Slicing Engine that is compatiable with all 3D printers we plan on using.
Once we have our GCODE we will write an algorithm that will parse and modify the GCODE to allow for Sinusoidal fill patterns of variable hieght and thickness.

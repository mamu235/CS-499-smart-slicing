<h2>Mitch's Weekly Project Log</h2>

<h3>3/2/18</h3>
<p>This week we had a meeting with our Customer, Dr. Hank Dietz. 
  We discussed how the discovery that Cura had implemented variable layer height slicing impacted our project.
  This also led us to be able tyo complete our Midterm Presentation, and meet with the Presentation U Team in the eStudio.
  We now understand our project to be using variable layer height and higher extrusion rates to allow us to increase the sturctural integrity of 3D printed objects.</p>

<h3>2/23/18</h3>
<p>This week I was able to fix the Project Log issue, and now we have 3 individual Project Logs.
  I also scheduled tentative meeting dates and project deadlines on the Project Timeline.
  We met with our Client on Friday and [].</p>

  I have updated the About Page to better reflect the project description, and the Project Requirements page with more clear requirements. 
  Also, I have added a Project Timeline Page to our Website, with a Google Calendar Widget.
  We determined met at the 3D Printing Lab and completed printer training and determined that we needed to meet with our client to review Project Status</p>

<p>I am having issues being able to split our Project Log into 3 separate logs, 1 for each Team Member.

  We have also added a Requirements Section to the Website, per Website Requirements. </p>

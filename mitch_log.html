<h2>Mitch's Weekly Project Log</h2>

<h3>3/30/18</h3>
<p>We have begun working on the Python 3.0 Parsing Script, as well as delving deeper into the formatting of GCODE.
  We have also begun discussing test cases, and planning for how and when to test.
  I will be tackling the beginning of our GCODE parsing script this weekend, and possibly so preliminary parsing.
  I will be setting up the parsong file on our Github Repo with a README file detailing how to get it to run.
</p>

<h3>3/23/18</h3>
<p>We decided to attempt a Python 3 based program that would take in a GCODE file, Identify the Header, Footer and Instruction code.
  We will them modify the Z value and Extrusion value according to a mathmatical Function that will later be outlined in our Design.
  We hope to have a Skeleton Program by end of week.
</p>

<h3>3/16/18</h3>
<p>This week was Spring Break, we did not plan to meet but I did some reseach into how we could parse a GCODE file.
  I along with Chris found out that CURA parses in the RepRap formatting of 3D printing.
</p>

<h3>3/9/18</h3>
<p>This Week we presented our Midterm Presentation.
  We made sure to review our requirements as we understood them from Dr. Dietz.
  We also finalized plans on how to tackle our design and began to refine them and talk about some specifics.
</p>

<h3>3/2/18</h3>
<p>This week we had a meeting with our Customer, Dr. Hank Dietz. 
  We discussed how the discovery that Cura had implemented variable layer height slicing impacted our project.
  This also led us to be able tyo complete our Midterm Presentation, and meet with the Presentation U Team in the eStudio.
  We now understand our project to be using variable layer height and higher extrusion rates to allow us to increase the sturctural integrity of 3D printed objects.
  I also spoke with Richard Anderson about allowing us to use some of the demo Prints from the 5th Floor ECE E.P.I.C. Makerspace for our presentation.</p>

<h3>2/23/18</h3>
<p>This week I was able to fix the Project Log issue, and now we have 3 individual Project Logs.
  I also scheduled tentative meeting dates and project deadlines on the Project Timeline.
  We met with our Client on Friday and [].</p>

<h3>2/16/18</h3>
<p>This Week I have attempted to update the Team Website to have 3 individual Project Logs, but no sucess. 
  I have updated the About Page to better reflect the project description, and the Project Requirements page with more clear requirements. 
  Also, I have added a Project Timeline Page to our Website, with a Google Calendar Widget.
  We determined met at the 3D Printing Lab and completed printer training and determined that we needed to meet with our client to review Project Status</p>

<h3>2/9/18</h3>
<p>I am having issues being able to split our Project Log into 3 separate logs, 1 for each Team Member. 
  I have emailed Dr. Piwowarski about the issue and was recommended to attempt to find a solution for the following week.
  We have also added a Requirements Section to the Website, per Website Requirements. </p>

<h3>2/5/18</h3>
<p>Mitch Launched the GitHub Pages site. Begun planning Team Meetings for 3D Printing training at the EPIC makerspace on the 5th floor of FPAT.
  Having Trouble separating the Project Log into 3 separate Sections for each Team Members Individual Posts. 
  Will be tackling this Issue Next Week.</p>

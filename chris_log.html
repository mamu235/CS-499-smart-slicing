<h2>Chris's Weekly Log</h2>

<h3>3/18/18</h3>
<p>
  The week of 3/5 - 3/9 was the presentation week that involved us finishing up last minute changes to our presentation. This week was mostly a focus for our team on midterms so we didn't accomplish much together outside of completing the presentation. Individually i continued to mess with the cnjs parser found in a repository that would get each line of gcode and store them in an area whih our program would then modify. This program itself runs in JSON so i've been working on understanding the baics of the language and being able to manipulate the source code in a way that allows for easier recombination of the final G-code. That is, this parser can seperate the individual lines but in doing so we currently still have to find a way to recombine the final product in a way that the machine will still recognize it. This is difficult since machine code can be large for larger objects and it can't be manually reconstructed. Going towards the end of the week after midterms i was trying to figure out a way to tackle this issue.
  The week of 3/10 - 3/18 was spring break and i tried to work on some of the issue found in the previous week but didn't get too much done. The group likely took this time to look at our individual responsibilities and will recombine the following week to get a workable script done within the next 2 weeks.

<h3>3/4/18</h3>
<p> Due to some time conflicts i was unable to attend our group meeting with Dr. Dietz this week but my group members caught me up on the discussion. We will be following a sinusoidal apporach to the printing of 3-D objects and will develop a scrip post slice to manipulate printing. This is likely the simplest approach as we would not have to develop GUI interfaces in CURA to allow slicing to be interpreted in the application. This week we also presented to Presentation U and got relatively good remarks on the delivery of content while still having some room for growth in our delivery. This past week i personally worked on my part of the presentation which was to focus on the technical constraints that our project has due to the hardware involved. When dealing with units in mm, it because important to understand the hardware used and even the material used and how it interacts with each other at differing temperatures. This will be important going forward as we look to see the limitations of sinusoidal printing with out current hardware (Prusca I3). </p>


<h3>2/25/18</h3>
<p> We had a meeting on the 24th and decided in which direction we would go forward with our project. We also set up a meeting later int the with Dr. Dietz to discuss our ideas and a meeting on Friday with Presentation U to practice our presentation. In the meeting yesterday we discussed a 'ladder' approach and a 'sinusoidal' approach to printing layers as opposed to the current planar prints used. We also discovered that Varisclice had developed a plugin for Cura so we decided it might work if you developed a plugin as well. In the following week one of us will look at developing plugins, the other will finsih up the website, and the other will work on the Presentation. This will all lead up to the meeting with Dr. Dietz</p>

<h3>2/16/18</h3>
<p>This week we figured out what method we wanted to approach the problem in. 
  Our current solutions are a plug in into the slicer Cura that will create variable z slicing on layers and extrusions. 
  This beat out the implementation of a program that would take the g-code and alter it directly. 
  Currently we are testing <a href="https://github.com/ChrisTerBeke/CuraVariSlicePlugin">this plug in</a> found in github by the creators of varislice that can be used with cura. 
  We currently need to see what kind of support it currently has and how it is implemented along with Cura. 
  We also need to discuss project direction if this plug in takes care of most of the project requirements and how Dr. Dietz would like us to further expand on the project. 
  We will have planned on a day to be set for testing, with each of us individually installing the plug-in into our machine to test with and also a day next week that will be to meet with Dr. Dietz and further establish project expectations. 
  This week was also set on getting familiar with another of the maker space labs and understanding <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Variable-Slicing-for-3D-Printing-on-Autodesk-Ember/">Varislice</a> coding and methology.</p>

<h3>2/9/18</h3>
<p>This week was a week to delve into the 3-D printing world and better understand the tools and programs that are to be used in this project. 
  By familiarizing myself with the programs <a href="https://ultimaker.com/en/products/ultimaker-cura-software">Cura</a> and <a href="https://www.onshape.com/">Onshape</a> I got a better understanding of how these are used to create files that are read by the 3-D printers and how to begin researching methods to use these and other open source tools to achieve the project goal. 
  A key point in discussing how to complete the project with Dr. Dietz was emphasizing that all the tools, code, means/methods does not need to be from scratch. 
  There is no need to build something from the ground up when others have already done leg work that is freely available and makes it both easier for us to complete the project and sometimes more reliable to use vetted (or at least known to work) tools that will help create the best product at the end. 
  Looking forward the next step is to bring forward what the group has found and delving into the work done by looking at the source code and understanding how the files are manipulated to present the 3-D printed with machine code (G-code) it understands. 
  The current variable z slicer that needs to be understood is <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Variable-Slicing-for-3D-Printing-on-Autodesk-Ember/">Varislice</a>, has the processing script as open source and can vary the z-axis for layers so it can be an extremely helpful tool to be used once the program is understood in a way that allows us to manipulate it for our purpose. 
  This week as per Dr. Dietz instruction was best spent familiarizing ourselves with the 3-D printing world since he was gone for most of it.</p>

	Originally our customer wanted us to focus on variable z layer changing and integrating it into a slicer or some post process so that a printer would vary layer height. The week after our assignment a major 3-D slicer Cura integrated Varislice into their program and our project had to be redirected. Our new project approach was to use the Z axis change along with an extrusion to create a smoother and non-linear layer. This was originally a stretch goal but seeing as the original concept was already implemented, this concept was our new goal. This new goal however, had no concrete work done on it where we could look at their code and use it for our project but rather it was a goal that would be researched and attempted to complete without knowledge if it was possible to succeed given the time frame. With this new goal we had to understand all the commands a slicer inserted into the g-code, so we knew what commands we had to affect to change extrusion rates, what commands needed to be the same (such as fan speed), and what commands needed to be inserted for z layer changing. This directed our project to go from a plugin for the slicer to a post process script to manually change the code for each layer. 

	This project thought us a lot about time management, wildcard effects, and working as a group on an assignment where multiple people couldn’t work on the same thing concurrently. Time was a big issue for us since it seemed like we spent an inordinate amount of time understanding the concepts of our project. A lot of the work we put in was spent understanding the hardware we were working on and the way the code we were trying to manipulate worked. We mostly put research duty to one person and that person relayed valuable information, but it created a back log of being unable to continue forward in our project until we had a solid grasp of a topic such as extrusion rate, feed rate, etc. We also had trouble with working on a program where it was a single file and multiple users editing wouldn’t provide much help if not become cumbersome for people to understand each other’s code within the same program. Finding ways to contribute while we were implementing a certain function or calculation in the program was not bad but there was certainly work that could have been done during this time that wasn’t.

	The biggest impact on our project was the Varislice plugin and its effect on our project goals. We were left confused and had to meet with the client again to understand what to do. Even after the meeting we did not know our implementation method until much later because of the change in project direction which was not ideal as we didn’t have much time to try out our method at the end of the semester. The problem with only a single file program was that sometimes it felt as if only a single person was truly contributing to the design of the project. We felt that our other members helped by discussing program implementation issues and verbally discussing functions and how they would implement but for the most part being unable to write code directly was something we learned could very well be a scenario in the industry.

	Starting over if we chose this project in our top choices it would have been wise to start investigating about the field before being assigned. It’s a vastly wide-ranging topic with a variety of hardware and design options friendly to beginners or diverse for experts.  This project takes a lot of time if the understanding of 3-D printing is minimal so having a better understanding at the start of the project would be something to change.
